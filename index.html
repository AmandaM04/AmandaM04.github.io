                very comical and smart 3 year old! She is my Motivation to be the best I can be! Coming from an e-commerce marketing
                background developing and maintaining online stores and websites sites for retail, entertainment, and manufacturing,
                I decided to advance my knowledge and pursue a professionally satisfying career in software development which led me
                to join Nashville Software School. This has been an amazing yet challenging career choice! I am ever so Thankful that
                I came across this school. I am seeking a quality team-oriented environment where I can contribute to a larger vision and
                continue to grow as a developer.
